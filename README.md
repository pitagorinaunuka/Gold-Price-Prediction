# Gold-Price-Prediction
If we take a look at the history, the gold has been used as a form of a currency in a lot of countries. 
Now, the gold is usually used to determine the strength of a country. This metal has brought a lot of investor's attention. 
Besides them, some people started using gold as a measure of how rich it makes them and as a form of safe and long-lasting investment. At the time, the USA was one of the main countries that used gold as a currency and financial assets, but nowdays, world's economies such as Russia, India, China, Australia and others are among the biggest sellers of this luxury metal. Many government investments are decided by their financial condition and strength, which is mainly measured in gold. Whenever the interest rates are lowered, the most aggressive buying was seen in the USA and China. Other countries which are not active sellers of the gold, keep the gold bars in the international banks. Some of them have a historical approach mixed with modern technologies in order to secure the gold bars. This is just one of the examples how 
countries value the gold and how it can be helpful to the economy of a country.
Linear regression, in machine learning, is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. It is the type of supervised1 learning, which is commonly used for predictive analysis. Regression is a technique that displays relationship between two or more variables. One explanatory variable case is called simple linear regression. When there are multiple variables, then the process is called multiple linear regression. In linear regression, all relationships are achieved using linear predictor functions, whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data.
Linear regression model can be used to fit a predictive model to an observed
dataset of values of response and explanatory variables. The most important uses
2 of the linear regression algorithm are: determining the strength of predictors ,
forecasting an effect and trend forecasting.
The hypothesis function used in linear regression model is represented by:
                      y = q0 + q1x,
where q0 and q1 are parameters. The main goal is to minimize the cost function.
